## Idea: 
Utilized MapKit and Live Activities to show Map which support different Map Configuration(Standard, Hybrid, Image) with different Elevation(.realistic, .flat) and emphasis(.default, .muted) style and Live Route Tracking with Look Around 3-D View at available places and showing updates of Route Tracking as Live Activity.

## Features
- Different Map Configuration
- Live Route Tracking from source location to destination.
- Look Around 3D View for supported Locations.
- Simulate Route Tracking Updates like Estimated Time of Arrival and Directions in Live Activity.
- List of direction instructions from source to destination route.

## Limitations 
- supports only on iOS 16.1 and onward devices, because Live Activity is available in iOS 16.1 onwards devices.
- For Testing in simulator GPX file is used to get fixed route coordinates for Live Location tracking in map.
- Information show in Live Activity are just simulation from Live Route Track and not any business information.
