## Hackathon 2022

## Idea: 
Utilized `MapKit` and `Live Activities` to show Map which support different Map Configuration(`Standard, Hybrid, Image`) with different Elevation(`.realistic, .flat`) and emphasis(`.default, .muted`) style and Live Route Tracking with Look `Around 3-D View` at available places and showing updates of Route Tracking as `Live Activity on Lock screen & on Dynamic Island`.

## Features
- Different Map Configuration
- Live Route Tracking from source location to destination.
- Look Around 3D View for supported Locations.
- Simulate Route Tracking Updates like Estimated Time of Arrival and Directions in Live Activity.
- List of direction instructions from source to destination route.

## Limitations 
- supports only on iOS 16.1 and onward devices, because Live Activity is available in iOS 16.1 onwards devices.
- For Testing in simulator GPX file is used to get fixed route coordinates for Live Location tracking in map.
- Information show in Live Activity are just simulation from Live Route Track and not any business information.
